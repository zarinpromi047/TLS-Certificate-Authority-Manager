In order to travel to another country in the real world you have to get a passport issued from your home country. Information in the passport shows informations such as \"issued by\", \"issued to\", and the validity period from \"issue date\" to \"expiration date\".\n","\n","To get a passport you have to apply for one in your home country and prove you are who you say you are by providing various credentials such as birth certificate, driver's license, etc. Furthermore, not just any entity can issue a passport.\n","\n","TLS certificates are issued in a similar manner. Instead of being issued by a country, certificates are issued by well-known Trusted Third Parties known as Certificate Authorities (CA). What is meant by \"well-known\"? A CA must go through rigorous checks and follow strict security procedures before it can become certified as a CA. Web browsers maintain a list of registered CAs that they then use as roots-of-trust. Any certificate issued by one of these CAs is considered as trustworthy by your web browser.\n","\n","How many CAs are there on planet Earth? There are hundreds of CAs throughout the globe. Your web browser keeps a list of trusted CA's in your web browser's trust-store. In Firefox you can view the list of trusted CAs by going to Preferences, Security & Privacy, View Certificates. There are similar mechanisms in other browsers.\n","A sample screen-shot showing just a few of the trusted CAs in Firefox is shown below:"],"metadata":{"id":"Yk1DszSpr6QL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<img src=\"http://cs.colostate.edu/~cs456/images/TLS_CA_List.png\" width='700px' />"],"metadata":{"id":"0IomzMySNtQo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UswOdnf_ORjL"},"source":["<a id='create_web_certificate'> </a>\n","### 2.1.
